## FLEDGE

This is stripped down FLEDGE implementation based on the one written by Tom Goethals.
It makes great use of [virtual-kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet)
to keep the code that is out of the scope of FLEDGE to a minimum.

Because [source of the virtual-kubelet cli](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/tree/master/cmd/virtual-kubelet)
of is particularly useful, the code is used as a starting point.
